              A1: We will use these labeled videos to <a href="https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine" target="_blank">train a deep neural network for detecting smoke emissions</a>.
              While deep neural networks have been proven to outperform traditional models in various applications, training such large networks requires a considerable amount of labeled data, which is why we need volunteers' help.
              As we gather more labeled videos, the AI system will begin to detect smoke emissions, and our team will design visualization for industrial pollution events.

              A2: Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03293.pdf" target="_blank">previous work in air quality monitoring</a> have shown that visualizing evidence of smoke emissions can influence the attitude of regulators.
              Also, using such visual data increased the community's confidence when addressing air pollution issues.

              A3: We selected and cropped several windows into videos from the <a href="https://breatheproject.org/learn/breathe-cam/" target="_blank">Breathe Cams network</a> (as shown in the following image).
              Each video contains 36 frames, which represent about 6 minutes in real-world time.

            <p class="text no-top-margin">
              A4: During labeling, videos need to play and loop automatically.
              However, if a mobile device has data saver enabled, videos will stop autoplay.
              Also, some mobile devices pause videos after users wake it up from sleeping mode.
              In order to enable autoplay, browsers require user interactions, which is why the system shows the dialog box.

                Q5: Why my labels did not pass the quality check? How did you define the quality?

            <p class="text no-top-margin">
              A5: For each batch (16 videos) on the page, the system randomly placed several videos with known answers, also called gold standards.
              A batch will pass the quality check if you label these gold standards correctly.

            <hr class="custom-text-info-dark-theme">
            <p class="text no-top-margin">
              A6: There can be two reasons.
              Firstly, videos that have closer times (e.g., 8 and 8:10 am) can look similar due to the same weather and lighting conditions.
              Secondly, gold standard videos for the quality check can appear again if you label many batches.

              A9: When labeling smoke, this tool shows 16 videos at the same time.
              Older devices have difficulties in playing these videos, which results in poor user experiences.

            <p class="text no-top-margin">
              A10: At least two volunteers will review each video.
              If their answers agree, the system marks the video according to the agreement.
              Otherwise, the video will be reviewed by an extra volunteer, and the result is aggregated based on majority voting.

            <p class="text no-top-margin">
              A11: Smoke emissions in nighttime videos (captured by commercial digital cameras) are extremely tough for the computer to recognize due to insufficient light.
              We want to focus on training the computer to detect daytime smoke emissions first.

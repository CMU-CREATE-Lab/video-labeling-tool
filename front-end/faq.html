            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We use the data to <a href="https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/deep-smoke-machine" target="_blank">train an AI model for recognizing smoke emissions</a>.
                The model is a deep neural network that can learn how to classify videos into two categories: having smoke or no smoke.
                Then, we use the model to recognize smoke for many dates and camera views (refer to our <a href="event.html" target="_blank">event page</a>).

            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>
                While deep neural networks have been proven useful in various applications (e.g., object recognition), training such networks requires a considerable amount of labeled data.
                Annotating all the data will take hundreds of hours for one reseacher, which is why we need help from volunteers.

                Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03293.pdf" target="_blank">previous work in air quality monitoring</a> shows that visualizing evidence of smoke emissions can influence the attitude of regulators.
                Also, using such visual data increased the community's confidence when addressing air pollution.

                Each video contains 36 frames, which represent about 6 minutes in real-world time.

                For each batch (16 videos) on the page, the system randomly placed several videos with known answers, also called gold standards.
                A batch will pass the quality check if you label these gold standards correctly.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The system defines the final label by aggregating answers from citizens and researchers.
                At least two volunteers or one researcher will review each video.
                If the answers from the two volunteers agree, the system marks the video according to the agreement.
                Otherwise, another volunteer or researcher will review the video, and the result is aggregated based on majority voting.

                Q7: Why sometimes a dialog box popped up and asked me to enable video autoplay?

            <hr>
            <ul>
              <li>
                During labeling, videos need to play automatically.
                If a mobile device has data saver enabled, videos will stop autoplay.
                Also, some mobile devices pause videos after users wake it up from sleeping mode.
                To enable autoplay, browsers require user interactions, which is why the system shows the dialog box.

              <li>
                Videos that have closer times (e.g., 8 and 8:10 am) can look similar due to the same weather and lighting conditions.
                Also, gold standard videos for the quality check can appear again if you label many batches.

                When labeling smoke, this tool shows 16 videos at the same time.

                Smoke emissions in nighttime videos (captured by commercial digital cameras) are tough for the computer to recognize due to insufficient light.

                The AI model can make mistakes.
                For example, steam and fast-moving cloud shadow may be recognized as industrial smoke emissions.
                One way to mitigate the problem is to train the model using more annotated videos.

                Processing videos involve many manual steps.

                Due to such limitations, we are currently unable to automate the smoke recognition system fully.

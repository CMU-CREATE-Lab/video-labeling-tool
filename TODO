TODO: add interactive tutorial

TODO: design user feedback system after labeling a batch (e.g., dialog box)
  - poor performance when labels are rejected
  - if the user made too many bad batches, ask the user to retake the tutorial
  - detect and mark spamming (e.g., all not selected, all selected) in the database

TODO: design features for sharing achievements
  - add a leaderboard for showing user id and scores
  - generate PDF certificates of label statistics for each user upon request
  - allow users to share the badge with their achievement on social media

TODO: add the feature for labeling smoke opacity
  - add a compass to show sun direction for each video (when labeling opacity)
TODO: add the feature for cropping videos to a region

TODO: refactor code based on https://codeburst.io/jwt-authorization-in-flask-c63c1acf4eeb

TODO: as users gain enough scores, advance them to the harder mode
  - laypeople mode: select videos that have smoke
  - amateur mode: label smoke opacity (low, medium, high)
  - expert mode: crop videos to a region
  - how to invalidate previous user tokens with different permissions?
  - need to add a table to record the promotion history
  - need to encode client type in the user token, and check if this matches the database record
  - for a user that did not login via google, always treat them as laypeople

BUG: when changing the client type of a user, previous tokens with different permissions are still working
  - need to invalidate previous issued tokens?

OPTIONAL: graphically display the label statistics (instead of using text)
OPTIONAL: add a playback timeline bar to show the video playback time
OPTIONAL: add a link back to time machine viewer (or a larger video) on the labeling page (also gallery page)
OPTIONAL: prevent the case that multiple people label the same data
  - add the last_queried_time to video and query the ones with last_queried_time <= current_time - lock_time
